# Flight_Predictor_App
A Simple R Shiny App, demonstrating a potential use case for using statistical modeling for predictive analysis

This app currently uses a multinomial logistic regression model for predicting if your flight will be early or on time!

The data used to build these models/application comes from the anyflights packages on CRAN!
